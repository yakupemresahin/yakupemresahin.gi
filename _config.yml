  Hi, my name's Yakup Emre and I'm a master's student in Physics with AI minor at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. My interest mainly lie in the intersection of physics and machine learning. I wonder what kind of new ML tools we can develop to use them in new physics discoveries. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>wondering</mark> and <mark>grilling</mark>

Though under entirely Turkish administration today, the university still maintains strong ties to the American educational system.

					During my time at Boğaziçi, which I started as an engineering student and graduated also with a double major in Physics with an overall GPA of 3.73/4.00, I tried to maintain a balance between coursework and research experience. 

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
